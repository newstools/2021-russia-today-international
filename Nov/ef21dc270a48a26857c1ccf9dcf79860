On Monday, 17 trade unions on the island of Martinique called for a general strike to show their opposition to a Covid-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers and the imposition of France’s coronavirus health pass. However, the situation escalated when the strikers were reportedly angered at not being received by the governor of Martinique at the end of their first day of demonstrations. While no injuries have been reported, law enforcement and firefighters were repeatedly targeted by gunfire as they intervened to put out blazes on public highways in the city of Fort-de-France on Monday night. ‼️🪧 #Martinique : De nombreux axes sont bloqués sur toute l’île.

Protesters have blocked roads around the Caribbean island and have made several demands of the government, including an end to the Covid-19 vaccination mandate for caregivers, as well as broader requests such as an increase in salaries and a reduction in fuel prices.
