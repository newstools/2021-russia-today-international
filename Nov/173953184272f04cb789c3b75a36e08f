Another, Musharaf Abdalla, was arrested on suspicion of involvement in a foiled plan to attack parliament buildings. He was later charged with possession of explosives, ammunition, and firearms. The third man was named by authorities as Joseph Juma Odhiambo, who was arrested while reportedly attempting to enlist with the Al Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group Al-Shabaab. All three suspects are dangerous, police have warned, but they did not say how Abdala, Abikar, and Odhiambo managed to escape. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!
