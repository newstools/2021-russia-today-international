The Hague has been the center of multiple other Covid protests, including one earlier this month against measures already in place for the unvaccinated. Rutte announced new Covid restrictions that will last three weeks, with most of the measures beginning on Saturday evening. Due to a spike in cases, the PM said that households will be limited to four people over the age of 13, public events such as sports matches will not have live crowds, social distancing is once-again advised, and stores will be forced to close early.
