The assailant, described in local reports as a man of sub-Saharan origin, walked through the neighborhood on Friday morning before reaching the health center where people were queuing for Covid-19 vaccinations. Eyewitnesses claimed that those outside had warned of the approaching knife-wielding man, and the doors of the facility were shut.

When the assault carried on, other officers also fired shots.” The man died at the scene. Reports suggest one officer sustained an injury to the hand during the altercation. In photos shared online, a heavy police presence can be seen in the area, and some streets are cordoned off. A white cloth was placed over the body of the deceased assailant, images showed.
