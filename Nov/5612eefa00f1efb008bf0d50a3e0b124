In Melbourne, Sky News reporter Sophie Elsworth described “tens of thousands of people streaming through the streets.” The march in Melbourne came after a week of smaller protests, aimed at Victoria Premier Dan Andrews’ controversial pandemic bill, which if approved by the state’s legislature would allow Andrews and Health Minister Martin Foley to declare an indefinite state of emergency and issue public health orders by decree – including “any order … that the minister believes is reasonably necessary to protect public health.” Tens of thousands of people keep streaming through the streets. Many I’ve spoken to are concerned about the state govt, Premier, vaccine mandates, the pandemic bill & what future holds for their kids. #melbourneprotestpic.twitter.com/smexulQ4ts— Sophie Elsworth (@sophieelsworth) November 20, 2021 Tens of thousands of people keep streaming through the streets.

Fines for noncompliance would range from up to AU$21,800 for people and AU$109,000 for businesses. Alternative media sources claimed that more than 100,000 people showed up to protest. However, the demonstration remained free of the violent clashes seen at protests in Melbourne in recent months.
