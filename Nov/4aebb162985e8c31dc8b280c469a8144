The official’s residence came under fire on Sunday morning local time. Iraq’s Security Media Cell claimed the attack was a “failed assassination attempt against the prime minister” which involved a “booby-trapped drone.” The Security Media Cell added that al-Kadhimi was in good health and that security forces were taking the necessary measures in the aftermath of the attack. There have also been reports of shots ringing out near al-Kadhimi’s home in the heavily fortified Green Zone. 🔴 #Iraq- Heavy gunfire and explosions heard with a rocket attack in #Baghdad’s Green Zone📹 pic.twitter.com/ZUWjg5syw3— Mete Sohtaoğlu (@metesohtaoglu) November 6, 2021 🔴 #Iraq- Heavy gunfire and explosions heard with a rocket attack in #Baghdad’s Green Zone📹 pic.twitter.com/ZUWjg5syw3 Soon after news of the attack went public, al-Kadhimi issued a statement on social media indicating he had not been hurt. “I was and still am a redemption project for Iraq and the people of Iraq. The missiles of treachery will not discourage the believers, and a hair will not be shaken in the steadfastness and insistence of our heroic security forces to protect the people, achieve the right and put the law in place,” the prime minister said. “I am fine, praise be to God, among my people,” he continued, and called for “calm and restraint from everyone” in the wake of the incident, “for the sake of Iraq.” The reported assassination attempt took place just a day after tense clashes erupted in Baghdad over the results of last month’s parliamentary election. Over 100 people were injured on Friday as protesters tried to storm Baghdad’s Green Zone, where the prime minister’s residence is located. Riot police responded to protests with tear gas and reportedly fired shots in the air. Several fires were set in the city. Reports indicated that the demonstrators were protesting the heavy losses of Iraq’s pro-Iran Shia parties, and alleged voter fraud, demanding a recount ahead of the release of the final results of the election. Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the Fatah Alliance of Shia parties, called the results of the election “fabricated” last month, and said he would not accept them. The biggest winner from the vote is considered to be the nationalist Saeroun movement, led by influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who is now expected to form a coalition government.
