This is the kind of open and transparent licence we need to move the needle on access during and after the pandemic. “The aim of the licence is to facilitate the rapid manufacture and commercialisation of CSIC’s COVID-19 serological test worldwide,” the WHO said in a press release, adding that the offer to low- and middle-income countries “will remain valid until the date the last patent expires.” The global deal, agreed with the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), will offer the test as a worldwide public good under a test permit signed by the WHO’s Medicines Patent Pool (MPP).
