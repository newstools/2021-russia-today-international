At least three people were killed and several more injured when an earthquake struck the popular Indonesian island of Bali on October 16 and triggered a landslide. A major 6.2-magnitude quake struck the island nation back in January, destroying scores of buildings, including a hospital, and causing over 100 fatalities. Located in a region dubbed the Pacific Ring of Fire – an arc-shaped area of frequent seismic activity – Indonesia is rocked by thousands of earthquakes annually.
