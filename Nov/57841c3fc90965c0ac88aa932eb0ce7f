Reuters and Al Jazeera reported that police fired live ammunition into the air to disperse the protesters. The demonstrators are believed to be supporters of pro-Iranian Shiite parties, which suffered heavy losses in the parliamentary election on October 10. The parties challenged the results, alleging vote fraud, including ballot counting irregularities. However, the election commission has already rejected most of the 1,300 appeals submitted by an umbrella group of Shia organizations. With the final results of the vote pending, people took to the streets on Friday, seeing it as “the last chance for the government [and the] election commission to hold a recount of all the votes,” according to Al Jazeera. Clashes and riots apparently continued into the night, as videos on social media show protesters erecting barricades and setting them on fire, as well as burning parked cars. الحشد الشعبي يقتتل المتظاهريين في العراق و قوات الامن تتصدى لهم في #بغداد#Iran#Iraq#Baghdad#عاجل#فورى#تازه#BreakingNews#BREAKINGpic.twitter.com/z7UHSEFpuP— Jamil Nur 🚨💥⌛ (@msary20082000) November 5, 2021 الحشد الشعبي يقتتل المتظاهريين في العراق و قوات الامن تتصدى لهم في #بغداد#Iran#Iraq#Baghdad#عاجل#فورى#تازه#BreakingNews#BREAKINGpic.twitter.com/z7UHSEFpuP Baghdad, Iraq 🇮🇶💥🔥 pic.twitter.com/9J4PT7MBx9— waheed (@Waheed0819) November 5, 2021 Baghdad, Iraq 🇮🇶💥🔥 pic.twitter.com/9J4PT7MBx9 There have been unconfirmed reports about at least two deaths among the protesters, but the rumors have not been confirmed by the Health Ministry. In a statement on Friday, the ministry said that most of the 125 injured were security and law enforcement officers, and that only 27 of those injured were civilians. No gunshot wounds and no deaths were reported, the ministry said, adding that most injuries were mild to moderate.

The early election held last month came in response to massive 2019 protests against corruption, poor services and unemployment. The vote saw several Shia parties losing support, but the biggest gains were made by a political force led by influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, which won 73 seats in the parliament out of a total of 329. Al-Sadr’s bloc is now expected to seek coalition partners to form a new government. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!
