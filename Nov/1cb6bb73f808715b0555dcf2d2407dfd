The municipality of Decani, like most of the province of Kosovo, is now majority ethnic-Albanian, although it is home to several important religious sites to the Orthodox Serbs. During the Kosovo War of 1998-1999, it was a stronghold of the anti-Serb militia known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Following the war and Kosovo’s split from Serbia in 2008, the area has been rebuilt with funding from western NGOs.
