Zuckerberg famously announced last Thursday that he was changing the name of his company – which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, among other platforms – to Meta, saying it better fitted his vision of “embodied internet.” While Americans memed and mocked the name change, Baidu Online Network Technology Company filed a trademark application for “MetaApp” with the Chinese authorities, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday, citing results of a search on the data platform Tianyan. Baidu’s trademark classification says it “involves website services and scientific instruments.” The Beijing-based company operates the second-largest search engine in the world after Google, as well as cloud services, news, music, advertising, augmented reality, and even a digital assistant service. However, it may have been too late to the “meta” game, as there is already a Chinese company called MetaApp – a sandbox developer also based in Beijing, specializing in mobile games for Google’s Android operating system.
