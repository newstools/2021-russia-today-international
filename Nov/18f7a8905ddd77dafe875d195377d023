The ministry announced on Sunday that it is working to confirm the potential cases. In a statement, it revealed that the eight individuals being tested had traveled to southern Africa within the past two weeks. They have been quarantined and their close contacts have been warned. French Minister of Health Olivier Veran said on Sunday morning it was only a “matter of hours” before cases of the new variant are discovered in the country. The Omicron variant has previously been detected in several countries, leading to travel restrictions on South Africa and a number of other nations where the variant has been spreading. The World Health Organization addressed the emerging variant this week, saying it opposes the closure of borders at the moment. It noted that there is still very little known about the new strain, such as whether it causes more severe illness or is more transferable.
