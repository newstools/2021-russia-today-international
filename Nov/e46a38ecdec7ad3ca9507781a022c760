Unlike during her previous pregnancy, Julie Anne Genter had not intended to cycle to hospital herself, but “it did end up happening,” she said on social media. The MP posted a photo of herself doing a 10-minute night ride on a cargo bike while experiencing contractions, as well as images of her and her partner Peter Nunns welcoming their new baby daughter.

Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson​ responded to the MP’s post on Instagram, saying that “aunty Marama is so happy for you all and so typical you cycled in again lol!!! Love to you and Peter and the babies.” Genter made international headlines in 2018, when she and Nunns went to hospital on regular bikes for her labor induction. She said there wasn’t “enough room in the car” for the support crew, and that the ride put her in the “best possible mood.” Their firstborn son came along shortly afterwards.
