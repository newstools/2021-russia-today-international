Rihanna is also only one of two living Barbados National Heroes, with the other being 85-year-old cricketeer Sir Garfield Sobers, who received the title in 1998. As National Hero of Barbados, Rihanna receives the full title of The Right Excellent Robyn Rihanna Fenty for life. The ceremony took place just after Barbados became a republic and ousted Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. Her Majesty was replaced by Dame Sandra Mason, who was sworn in as the first president of Barbados on midnight, Tuesday in a ceremony attended by Prince Charles. Though Rihanna’s music career took off in the United States, she was born and raised in the Barbados parish of St. Michael, where she was discovered by American music industry producers. Before being made National Hero of Barbados, Rihanna served as a Barbadian ambassador since September 2018.
