A large crowd of protesters showed up at Rotterdam’s iconic Coolsingel street on Friday evening to denounce a new round of pandemic measures, including an ongoing partial lockdown, a ban on New Year’s Eve fireworks displays, as well as fears the government will impose a ‘2G’ pass system allowing only the vaccinated and those who’ve recently recovered from the virus to enter a long list of public places.

Footage of the heated protest circulated online, some clips showing a police squad car fully engulfed in flames after it was apparently torched by rioters. 🇳🇱 Pays-Bas : Des émeutes sont en cours à #Rotterdam en marge d'une manifestation contre les restrictions sanitaires.⚠️ Soyez prudents si vous êtes dans cette zone. pic.twitter.com/iN1eYHtCbO— Alerte France (@AlerteFR) November 19, 2021 🇳🇱 Pays-Bas : Des émeutes sont en cours à #Rotterdam en marge d'une manifestation contre les restrictions sanitaires.⚠️ Soyez prudents si vous êtes dans cette zone. pic.twitter.com/iN1eYHtCbO 🇳🇱 #Rotterdam : Scènes de chaos dans les rues de Rotterdam. pic.twitter.com/Ws0AZRfjOW— Alerte France (@AlerteFR) November 19, 2021 🇳🇱 #Rotterdam : Scènes de chaos dans les rues de Rotterdam. pic.twitter.com/Ws0AZRfjOW Demonstrators were also seen launching fireworks at police, who appeared to respond with large quantities of tear gas, which at one point blanketed the area. 🇳🇱 #Rotterdam : Scènes de chaos dans les rues de Rotterdam. pic.twitter.com/ScV9E9Y4ko— Alerte France (@AlerteFR) November 19, 2021 🇳🇱 #Rotterdam : Scènes de chaos dans les rues de Rotterdam. pic.twitter.com/ScV9E9Y4ko Violent protests against #coronavirus-restrictions in #Rotterdam today, Netherlands.Choas and sound of explosions. pic.twitter.com/gAbj5U2Vqj— Ahmad Algohbary (@AhmadAlgohbary) November 19, 2021 Violent protests against #coronavirus-restrictions in #Rotterdam today, Netherlands.Choas and sound of explosions. pic.twitter.com/gAbj5U2Vqj Local law enforcement said that officers deployed a mobile riot control unit to Coolsingel and unleashed water cannon on protesters who refused to clear the streets, also noting that some arrests were made after an emergency order was imposed to cordon off the area. #Rotterdam oggi 19/11/21 città nel caos pic.twitter.com/CYQ3Lk5YdE— Panta Rei 🇮🇹😎✝️ (@rej_panta) November 19, 2021 #Rotterdam oggi 19/11/21 città nel caos pic.twitter.com/CYQ3Lk5YdE The Dutch government announced the fireworks ban earlier on Friday, saying it is meant to “prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on healthcare, law enforcement and first responders.” However, while private displays are prohibited, officials said that local governments may still put on fireworks shows so long as their Covid-19 restrictions allow it. The Netherlands currently has a ‘3G’ rule in place, allowing the vaccinated, the recently recovered, as well as those who test negative for the virus to enter most public spaces. But as the country remains under a partial three-week lockdown to rein in growing infections, officials are now mulling the stricter ‘2G’ scheme, prompting the intense demonstrations seen on Friday night.
