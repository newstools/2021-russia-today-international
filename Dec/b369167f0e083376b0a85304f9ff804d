The fire erupted at the Burj el-Shemali camp located just outside the southern Lebanese city of Tyre late on Friday. The camp is the second-largest settlement of 12 Palestinian refugee camps scattered across the country. Unverified footage from the scene circulating online shows a building engulfed in flames, with a subsequent explosion sending a massive mushroom-shaped plume of smoke into the air. The shockwave apparently broke windows in buildings nearby as well. أنفجار مستودع أسلحة في مخيم البرج الشمالي في صور pic.twitter.com/ctfdbjHLsD— Von Justav (@Von3Juv3VJSH31) December 10, 2021 أنفجار مستودع أسلحة في مخيم البرج الشمالي في صور pic.twitter.com/ctfdbjHLsD Several smaller explosions were also heard during the blaze, another video from the scene purports to show. #عاجل|| إنفجار كبير في مخيم البرج الشمالي للاجئين الفلسطينيين من #لبنان، الله يلطف بأهلنا هناك.. pic.twitter.com/BrOoyJYDng— أدهم أبو سلمية #فلسطين 🇵🇸 (@adham922) December 10, 2021 #عاجل|| إنفجار كبير في مخيم البرج الشمالي للاجئين الفلسطينيين من #لبنان، الله يلطف بأهلنا هناك.. pic.twitter.com/BrOoyJYDng The fire prompted an evacuation of nearby buildings, with multiple emergency crew deployed to battle the flames.
