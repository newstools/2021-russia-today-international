Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency has confirmed the death of 13 people as a result of the eruption of the Semeru volcano, which began spewing ash on Saturday, completely blocking the sun at one point. The eruption coincided with heavy rains, and saw ash turning into thick mud and obliterating a key bridge and the homes in its path. Gladak Perak Bridge, a local landmark connecting two villages, was reported to have been completely destroyed by the mudflows. #volcano#eruption Mount #Semeru erupts Java island #Indonesia.
