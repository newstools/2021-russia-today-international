Another event for around 400 people took place at the same time in an adjoining space at the center, and after the concert ended, all 2,000 people mixed in the foyer for an afterparty. Before the concert, crowds accumulated by the venue, as everyone was asked to show a valid coronavirus pass proving vaccination, recovery from Covid, or a negative PCR test to be allowed to attend. The director of the venue told the media that it had “followed the authorities’ guidelines” on the anti-coronavirus measures. The DJ also commented to the media, saying “it is very unfortunate that infection has been found anyway.” READ MORE: One Omicron case triggers 2-week shutdown of children’s emergency ward The venue urged everyone who visited it on Saturday to take a PCR test, TV2 Nord news reported. Concertgoers can show tickets at test venues in Aalborg to be checked without an appointment. However, no self-isolation has been requested, with the warning only asking those who experience any symptoms of the illness to avoid further contacts. The earlier cases of the new Omicron variant confirmed in Denmark were found in patients who had traveled to South Africa, according to health officials. The infected concertgoer also traveled before the event, they said, without providing any more details.
