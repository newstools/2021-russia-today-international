Witnesses also spoke about dozens of injuries, with some people being left unconscious and others sustaining head wounds. “I got hit and fell down in front of a truck.

Myanmar has been gripped by unrest since February when the military moved to arrest Aung San Suu Kyi and the country’s other top officials. Last month, they were charged with election fraud during the 2020 vote, but have rejected the accusations. International observers, who worked at the election said it was mostly free and fair. Thousands of people took to streets across the country in the wake of the coup, but faced a violent crackdown, with police and military often resorting to the use of live fire against crowds. More than 1,300 demonstrators have been killed in Myanmar during the last ten months, according to prisoners’ aid organization AAPP. The military denies these numbers. The scale of demonstrations has subsided since the coup, with many protesters switching to guerrilla tactics and staging smaller ‘flash mob’ rallies across the country.
