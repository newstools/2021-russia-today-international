In a two-minute video making the rounds on social media Thursday, the nurses can be seen wearing dark blue scrubs, all but two behind black face masks, belting out ‘We Need a Little Christmas’ as they do a little dance. The performance appears to be from a Christmas special recorded earlier this month and aired on PBS Tuesday – the first such event since 2016, as none were made during the Trump administration. ‘We Need a Little Christmas’ is a song from the 1966 musical “Mame,” originally performed by Angela Lansbury. President Joe Biden does not make an appearance in the clip, but his wife Jill is visible at one point, wearing a pink outfit – and no mask – as she looks on.

Northwell fired 1,400 employees in October and then declared itself fully in compliance with Biden’s vaccine mandate.
